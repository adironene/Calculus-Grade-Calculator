# Calculus-Grade-Calculator

Hey Mrs. James. I promised you a calculator so here it is. I was going to install some software to run a C++ code but
I figured that it might be too inconvenient for you so I made it into a minimal website. 

all you have to do is click [here](https://ForMrsJames.feiyangtang.repl.co) and you should be able to access it.

I set it so that the page doesn't refresh after submitting so all you have to do is change the student grade and the percent
you want to add (I presume that the total points of exam and the exam weight is same for everybody so).

If you're interested in the calculation behind, I left the code in index.html in this repository. 

Also, I could have decorated the page a lot more but I figured it's not necessary since I could be using that time to grind APUSH.
If there's any error, lmk (not just this year but in the future as well).
